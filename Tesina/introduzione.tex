In this chapter, we will explain creation of database, from code point of view and design point of view. As explained in introduction chapter, the impl\\
lementaion of the database is made using MongoDB, the noSQL DBMS, through mongoose, the JavaScript interface beetween the program and the database.
\\
The approach followed by this technique allows a more efficient way of handling those objects. In fact, using mongoose's schemas to define objects of the\\
database, permits to treat database models like any JavaScript object. To achieve this, MongoDB uses documents, a set of key-value pairs, stored in \\
collections, held by a database. 
\\
In the following part, we will see objects that form our database model.
